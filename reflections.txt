# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
  Probably 3 - 4 hours
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
  Several Ruby syntax challenges, such as switch and trailing if statement. Also, Mixin is a new concept for me, I found module can access instance variable if it's included. but you must make sure that instance variable exists.

  - Print list as a table
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
